# Set Up

## Windows

If you are on Windows, I highly recommend doing the following:

First, install and setup chocolatey.

Next, install the following packages:

```bash

choco install strawberryperl

choco install miktex

```

Then, start the Miktex Console and switch to Administrator and run "check for updates".

Finally, I highly recommend the following VS Code extensions:

- LaTeX Workshop

## OSX / Linux

If you're on a non-windows platform, I still highly suggest the VSCode extension, but you can even use Nix/Devenv/Direnv to setup the dependencies automatically when you `cd` into the directory. Definitely check it out!
